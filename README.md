React and Spring Boot Integration with MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a basic full-stack application using React with Material UI for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application connects to MongoDB for data storage. A simple form is built to send data to the backend API, which stores it in MongoDB.
Features

    Frontend: Built with React and styled using Material UI components.
    Backend: Spring Boot REST API for handling data submissions.
    Database: MongoDB for storing submitted data.
    Form Handling: A form that allows users to input data, which is sent to the backend via an API.

Technologies Used
Frontend

    React: For building interactive user interfaces.
    Material UI: For UI components and layout.
    Axios/Fetch API: For making API calls to the Spring Boot backend.

Backend

    Spring Boot: For building REST APIs.
    Spring Data MongoDB: For interacting with MongoDB.

Database

    MongoDB: For storing and managing data.

Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm: For running the React frontend.
    Java 11+: For running the Spring Boot backend.
    MongoDB: A MongoDB server should be running locally or in the cloud.
